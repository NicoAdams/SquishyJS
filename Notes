Notes on the performance of the simulation

-- EXPERIMENT: Finding stable parameters --

Center averaged: The center point has zero velocity, and its position is taken as the average of all other points

(1)
kEdge = 10
Undamped
Center has 0 velocity and average position

Stable for kCenter < 8
